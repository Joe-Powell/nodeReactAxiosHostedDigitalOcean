What Is CI/CD? = Continuous integration/continuous delivery. processes that help software development teams deliver
 code changes more frequently and reliably. CI/CD is part of DevOps, which helps shorten the software development lifecycle.

 1 make file app.js
 2 npm init -y
 2 npm i express
 3 express boiler plate in app.js
 4 make express route with res.send('name')
 5 install front-end npx create-react-app frontend
 6 remove git from the react app because it come automatically, cd into the react app then type: rm -rf .git, use gitbash not the built in terminal.
 7 cd back into global folder and type: git init, we want the whole folder to be git
 8 cd into frontend and tyype: npm i axios ,with axios we will make calls to the back-end
 9 go into App.js, the one inside src of frontend, and delete everything inside the return as well as the logo import.
 10 type: import axios from 'axios'; at top of src App.js
 11  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 12 const [userName, setUsername] = useState('') and  useEffect(() => {     }, []) runs once when page loads
 13 make proxy inside package.json for the frontend, type after browserslist: ,"proxy":"http://localhost:5000"  
  *OR add cors to your app.js server npm i cors, then const cors = require('cors), app.use(cors())  no proxy needed in package.json for this
 14 create a useEffect and make a function to fire inside of it called getNames(), make async await for that call
 15 getNames() will have a response of the axios call asynchronously 

     useEffect(() => {
        getNames();
      }, [])

  const getNames = async() => {
    const response = await axios.get('/names')
     console.log(response)
  }

 16 make sure your cd into the front-end and type: npm start to start the react app.
 17 innitialize the back-end, open another terminal, cd go to root folder of the project, make sure the package.json
   of the server has a "start": "node app.js" , and then npm start. by now you will see in the console.log the response data
 18 go inside App.js of react and in the function getNames make a setUsername(response.data) then in the return put <> <h3>My name is:{userName}</h3> </>
